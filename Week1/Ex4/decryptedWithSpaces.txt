i came to security from cryptography and thought of the problem in a military like fashion most writings about security come from this perspective and it can be summed up pretty easily security threats are to be avoided using prevent ive countermeasures this is how encryption works the threat is eavesdropping and encryption provides the prophylactic this could all be explained with block diagrams alice is communicating with bob both are identified by boxes and there is a line between them signifying the communication eve is the eavesdropper she also is a box and has a dotted line attached to the communications lines he is able to intercept the communication the only way to prevent eve from learning what alice and bob are talking about is through a preventive countermeasure encryption theres no detection theres no response theres no risk management you have to avoid the threat for decades we have used this approach to computer security we draw boxes a round the different players and lines between them we defined if ferent attackers eavesdroppers impersonators thieves and their capabilities we use preventive counter measures like encryption and access control to avoid different threats if we can avoid the threats weve won if we cant weve lost imagine my surprise when i learned that the world doesnt work this way some history from the vigenere wiki page the first well documented description of apolyalphabetic cipher was formulated by leon battista alberti a round and used a metal cipher disc to switch between cipher alphabets albert is system only switched alphabets after several word sandswitches were indicated by writing the letter of the corresponding alphabet in the cipher text later in johannes trithemius in his work poligraphia invented the tabula recta a critical component of the vigenre cipher the trithemius cipher however only provided a progressive rigid and predictable system for switching between cipher alphabets what is now known as the vigenere cipher was originally described by giovan battis tabella so in his book la cifradel siggio van battis tabella so he built upon the tabula recta of trithemius but added a repeating counter signa key to switch cipher alphabets every letter where asalberti and trithemius used a fixed pattern of substitutions bellasos scheme meant the pattern of substitutions could be easily changed simply by selecting a new key keys were typically single words or short phrases known to both parties in advance or transmitted out of band along with the message bellasos method thus required strong security for only the key asitis relatively easy to secure a short key phrase say by a previous private conversation bellasos system was considerably more secure blaise devigenere published his description of a similar but stronger auto key cipher before the court of henry iii of france in later in the th century the invention of bellasos cipher was mis attributed to vigenere david kahn in his book the code breakers lamented them is attribution by saying that history had ignored this important contribution and in stead named aregressive and elementary cipher for him vigenere though he had nothing to do with it the vigenere cipher gained a reputation for being exceptionally strong noted author and mathematician charles lutwidge dodgson lewis carroll called the vigenere cipher unbreakable in his piece the alphabet cipher in a childrens magazine in scientific american described the vigenre cipher as impossible of translation this reputation was not deserved charles babbage is known to have broken a variant of the cipher as early as however he didnt publish his work kasiski entirely broke the cipher and published the technique in the th century even before this though some skilled cryptanalysts could occasionally break the cipher in the th century crypto graphic slider
uleusedas a calculation aid by the swiss army between and the vigenere cipher is simple enough to be a field cipher if it is used in conjunction with cipher disks the confederate states of america for example used a brass cipher disk to implement the vigenere cipher during the american civil war the confederacys messages were far from secret and the union regularly cracked their messages throughout the war the confederate leadership primarily relied upon three keyphrases manchester bluff complete victory and as the war came to a close come retribution gilbert vernam tried to repair the broken cipher creating the vernamvigenere cipher in but no matter what he did the cipher was still vulnerable to cryptanalys is vernams work however eventually led to the one timepad a provably unbreakable cipher
